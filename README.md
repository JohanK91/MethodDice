# MethodDice
Pig (Dice game) in python, for school. 
Thank you for buying our Pig game! 
To play the game, run the "main.py" file. 
Use the keyboard to play the game according to the instructions on the screen. 
The goal is the reach 100 points first.
By stopping your turn, you save your rolled points, and the opponent may roll.
However, rolling a 1, means you lose all your rolled points, and the opponent may roll.
You can play against a friend in our 2 player duel, or fight solo against our advanced AI.
Good luck!
